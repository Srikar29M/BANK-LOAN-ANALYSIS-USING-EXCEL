# BANK-LOAN-ANALYSIS-USING-EXCEL

## Overview
This project involves the creation of comprehensive Excel dashboards that provide a detailed analysis of loan data. The dashboards are designed to help users track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications, funding amounts, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. The dashboards are interactive, allowing for dynamic analysis and filtering based on various criteria such as loan grade and purpose.
